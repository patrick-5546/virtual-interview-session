# virtual-interview-session

Virtual Interview Session is a mock interview tool that provides practice interview sessions to users.
Users can record themselves practicing interview questions and receive statistics on eye contact frequency, semantics, and speech clarity.
This will allow users to self-evaluate their own interview performance.
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/patrick-5546/virtual-interview-session/wiki) for this project's documentation.
